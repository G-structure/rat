## Programming Jokes

Why do programmers prefer dark mode?
Because light attracts bugs, and they've already got 99 problems and a bug ain't... wait, that's all of them.

Because they always overfit to the training data and can't generalize to new social situations.

What's a data scientist's favorite type of music?
Neural networks and chill. They love those deep learning beats.

## Bonus Cloud & DevOps Jokes
