# RAT (Rust Agent Terminal)
## High-Performance ACP Client for Claude Code & Gemini

### Executive Summary

RAT is a high-performance terminal-based ACP (Agent Client Protocol) client written in Rust, leveraging tachyonfx for stunning visual effects. The project creates a unified interface for interacting with multiple AI coding agents (Claude Code and Gemini CLI) through a standardized protocol, providing a superior alternative to traditional terminal interactions with rich visual feedback, structured edit reviews, and **multi-agent control capabilities**. 

RAT enables developers to manage and control multiple agents simultaneously - switching between different agents for different tasks, running parallel sessions, and maintaining multiple concurrent conversations with different AI models.

## ACP‚ÄëAligned TUI UI Plan (Deep Dive)

Task: Define and scope all UI elements in RAT‚Äôs TUI that are directly supported by the Agent Client Protocol (ACP), including agent plans, tool calls, permission prompts, diffs, and related flows. This plan is derived from ACP‚Äôs schema and examples in `agent-client-protocol`, the Claude Code ACP adapter, and our local ACP guide.

Context:
- RAT is an ACP client and must render the full set of ACP streaming updates and agent‚Üíclient requests.
- References reviewed: `rat/ACP.md` (local spec), `agent-client-protocol` (schema + Rust client), `claude-code-acp` (real agent emitting plan/tool/diff/availableCommands), and existing RAT TUI scaffolding.
- Goal: add UI affordances that map 1:1 to ACP features with minimal client‚Äëside invention.

Approach:
- MVP first: prioritize read‚Äëonly rendering for all ACP updates, plus interactive permission selection. Add navigation + streaming polish next. Defer UNSTABLE terminal features behind a feature flag.
- Keep RAT non‚Äëblocking: stream updates into state; the draw loop renders snapshots.
- Tests-first for each element as we implement (snapshot frames via `insta`).

Scope of UI Elements (ACP‚Äëbacked):

1) Chat Stream (session/update: agent_message_chunk, user_message_chunk, agent_thought_chunk)
- Render Markdown text chunks with syntax highlighting for code fences.
- Show images where present (inline thumbnail with open‚Äëfull action if supported; fallback: placeholder + metadata).
- ‚ÄúThoughts‚Äù collapsed by default with a toggle to expand; visually distinct from user‚Äëvisible content.
- Stream-safe: accumulate chunks per turn; show typing indicator while receiving.

2) Agent Plan Panel (session/update: plan)
- Read‚Äëonly task list showing entry content, priority, and status (pending/in_progress/completed).
- Replace‚Äëon‚Äëupdate semantics: each incoming plan replaces the entire list (per spec).
- Visual cues: status icons, progress bar (% completed), priority color.
- Navigation: jump between plan and related tool calls/messages in the same turn.

3) Tool Calls Panel (session/update: tool_call, tool_call_update)
- Card per tool call with: title, kind (read/edit/delete/move/search/execute/think/fetch/other), status (pending/in_progress/completed/failed).
- Stream content items: text/resource/resource_link/diff/(terminal if enabled) with incremental updates.
- Locations list: file paths and optional line numbers; actions to preview, open, or follow.
- Collapsible details with compact timeline view; show rawInput/rawOutput in an ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù foldout.

4) Diff Review (ToolCallContent: { type:"diff", path, oldText|null, newText })
- Unified view (MVP) with optional side‚Äëby‚Äëside; syntax highlighting; hunk navigation.
- If oldText is null, treat as create/overwrite preview; otherwise show additions/deletions.
- Accept/Reject affordances are contextual to permission requests (see #5). Outside a permission prompt, diffs are preview‚Äëonly.

5) Permission Requests Dialog (session/request_permission)
- Modal dialog with tool summary (title/kind/locations), a focused diff/file preview when available, and options from `options[]`.
- Option kinds: allow_once, allow_always, reject_once, reject_always (used for labels/shortcuts only; the agent defines policy).
- Required flows:
  - Submit selected option to agent, or
  - If turn was cancelled (`session/cancel`), auto‚Äërespond with `cancelled`.
- Queue multiple concurrent permission prompts; show clear context for which tool call each corresponds to.

6) Locations & Following (ToolCall.locations)
- When locations contain paths/lines, show a contextual preview and allow jump‚Äëto/peek.
- ‚ÄúFollow along‚Äù toggle: auto‚Äëscroll tool/diff panels to the most recent location when enabled.

7) Available Commands & Slash UX (session/update: available_commands_update)
- Command palette with name/description and argument hint (from Claude Code adapter).
- Type `/` in chat input to filter + insert commands with argument placeholders; display MCP‚Äëbacked commands when advertised.

8) Authentication Flow (initialize.authMethods, auth_required errors)
- If `initialize` advertises `authMethods`, show a setup banner with selectable auth method(s) and guidance.
- When the agent raises auth required (e.g., Claude prompts to run `/login`), surface a prominent call‚Äëto‚Äëaction.

9) Session Lifecycle UI (session/new, session/load replay)
- New: show connected banner with capabilities summary (promptCapabilities, loadSession).
- Load: show replay progress while the agent replays history via `session/update`; then mark ‚Äúready‚Äù.

10) Stream & Cancellation State (session/cancel and stopReason)
- ‚ÄúCancel Turn‚Äù action; after sending cancel, mark the turn as cancelling and continue displaying late updates until the agent responds with `stopReason: cancelled`.
- Stop reason toast on completion: end_turn, max_tokens, max_turn_requests, refusal, cancelled.

11) Terminal (UNSTABLE, feature‚Äëflagged)
- Optional panel for ‚Äúterminal‚Äù ToolCallContent if emitted; background terminal progress + last output.
- Controls gated by ACP unstable client methods (create/release/kill/wait_for_exit/terminal_output).

12) Client FS Integration (fs/read_text_file, fs/write_text_file)
- No direct UI action beyond previews and write confirmations.
- Ensure all file paths are absolute; show a small ‚Äúedited‚Äù badge in status bar when writes occur.

13) Status Bar & Notifications
- Connection state, active agent/session, streaming indicator, plan progress, pending permission count.
- Non‚Äëblocking toasts for errors and important state changes.

14) Audio Content (ContentBlock::audio)
- Gated by `promptCapabilities.audio`. In chat and tool content streams, show an audio attachment chip with mime/duration when available.
- If playback support is implemented, add play/pause/mute controls; otherwise provide a ‚Äúsave/open externally‚Äù action and clearly indicate no inline playback.

15) Prompt Composer Attachments (capability‚Äëaware)
- Allow attaching files/resources when composing prompts:
  - Use embedded `resource` when `embeddedContext:true` and the file is readable; otherwise fall back to `resource_link`.
  - Support image attachments only if `image:true`; audio only if `audio:true`.
- Validate absolute paths before send; provide helper to convert relative paths to absolute based on the session `cwd`.

16) Resource and Resource Link Rendering in Chat/Tools
- For `resource_link`, render a compact chip with `name`, optional `title/size/mimeType`, and actions: preview (if text), open externally, copy URI.
- For embedded `resource` (text/blob), render a short preview with expand action; for binary show metadata + save option.

17) Refusal Stop Reason UX
- When `stopReason: refusal`, show a banner explaining the agent refused to continue and that the next turn should not auto‚Äëappend the prior user message.
- Offer a clear CTA to ‚ÄúStart new turn‚Äù and optionally adjust composer hinting.

18) Permission Policy Memory
- When user selects `allow_always`/`reject_always`, remember a client‚Äëside policy scoped by agent and optionally session.
- Provide a UI to view and clear remembered policies (settings panel or command palette action).

19) Initialization & Version/Capability UI
- On successful `initialize`, show capability summary (promptCapabilities, loadSession). On version mismatch (client can‚Äôt support agent‚Äôs returned MAJOR), display a graceful error view with retry/help.
- Provide quick toggles to advertise FS capabilities and an indicator when FS is disabled.

20) Large Content Truncation & Performance Policy
- Define truncation for long text blocks, large diffs, images, and audio metadata (e.g., preview first N KB, with ‚ÄúOpen full‚Äù/‚ÄúSave‚Äù actions).
- Ensure streaming remains responsive; chunk rendering and backpressure in the UI loop.

21) Accessibility & Keybindings for Media/Attachments
- Add keys for attach file/image/audio in composer, and for media playback or opening attachments.
- Document keys alongside existing interaction model.

22) MCP Servers Summary & Config
- During session creation, show which MCP servers will be connected (name, command, args). Provide a settings view to edit per‚Äëproject MCP servers and environment variables.
- Display a compact summary in the connected banner for quick visibility.

23) Content Annotations (MCP‚Äëcompatible)
- Where present on content blocks, surface lightweight metadata: `lastModified`, `priority`, and `audience` hints (e.g., subtle badges or tooltips). Safe to omit when absent.

Interaction Model & Keybindings (additions)
- Space/Enter: expand/collapse focused tool card or plan item.
- p: toggle plan panel; t: toggle tool calls; d: focus diff; /: open commands palette; c: cancel turn.
- y / n: select allow/reject in permission modal; A: allow always; R: reject always.
- j/k or arrows: navigate lists; g/G: first/last; f: follow locations toggle.
 - a: attach file in composer; i: attach image; u: attach audio (if capability supported).
 - Media: space to play/pause (when focused), m to mute.

Data Model Hooks (state additions)
- plan: Vec<PlanEntry>
- tool_calls: ordered map keyed by toolCallId with status, kind, content[], locations[]
- permission_queue: FIFO of pending prompts with toolCallId + options[]
- stream_state: { receiving: bool, stop_reason: Option<StopReason> }
- commands: Vec<AvailableCommand>

Phased Delivery
- MVP (Phase 2/3):
  - Render chat chunks, plan panel (read‚Äëonly), tool calls list with diff preview, permission dialog with selection, cancellation flow, stop reason toasts, locations preview, commands palette (read‚Äëonly insert).
- Enhanced (Phase 4+):
  - Side‚Äëby‚Äëside diffs, hunk‚Äëlevel navigation, follow mode polish, raw IO foldouts, thought‚Äëchunk toggle animations, images previewer, terminal (unstable) under feature flag, tachyonfx transitions.

Verification (planned as we implement)
- Snapshot tests (`insta`) for: plan rendering state transitions; tool call lifecycle (create‚Üíupdate‚Üícomplete/failed); diff preview; permission modal with options; cancellation state and stop reason banners; commands palette entries.
- Property tests for diff hunk navigation invariants.
- Mutation tests on parsing/merge of streaming updates.

Remaining / Risks
- Terminal is unstable; isolate behind a feature flag to avoid churn.
- Some agents omit oldText in diffs; ensure previews remain useful.
- Images and large content blocks require careful buffer management and truncation policies.
- Multiple concurrent permission requests must be queued and clearly disambiguated.

Next
- Wire ACP update handlers to TUI state for: plan, tool_call, tool_call_update, available_commands_update.
- Implement permission modal and response plumbing for `session/request_permission`.
- Add diff preview component reading ToolCallContent:diff.
- Add minimal commands palette using `availableCommands`.
- Snapshot tests for the above; land incrementally.

## ACP Simulator for UI Development

Task: Provide a no‚Äëcredits, deterministic ACP agent simulator to design, human‚Äëtest, and iterate RAT‚Äôs UI without relying on Claude Code or network access.

Why
- Enables rapid UI prototyping of all ACP features (plans, tool calls, diffs, permissions, cancellation, stop reasons, command palette, auth) with fully controlled streams.
- Deterministic, seedable runs for reproducible snapshots and mutation tests.
- Human‚Äëtesting friendly: speed controls, pause/step, scenario switching.

Approach
- Add an example binary `examples/sim_agent.rs` implementing `agent_client_protocol::Agent`, communicating over stdio.
- Drive scripted `session/update` sequences and `session/request_permission` calls regardless of prompt contents.
- Provide multiple scenarios via CLI flags: `--scenario`, `--speed`, `--seed`, `--loop`.
- Use the crate‚Äôs `example_agent.rs` pattern (LocalSet + mpsc) to stream notifications.

Scenarios (initial set)
- happy_path_edit: plan ‚Üí tool_call(edit+diff) ‚Üí permission ‚Üí accepted ‚Üí tool_call_update(completed) ‚Üí message ‚Üí end_turn.
- multi_tools: two concurrent tool calls (search then edit), interleaved updates, locations following.
- failure_path: tool_call fails ‚Üí update(status=failed) ‚Üí agent_msg explaining; stopReason=end_turn.
- cancellation: stream for a while; after client sends `session/cancel`, finish pending updates then respond with `stopReason=cancelled`.
- large_diff: big file edit with multiple hunks; test navigation and performance.
- images_and_thoughts: emit image chunks and thought chunks; verify collapsible rendering.
- auth_required: on first prompt, error path that implies auth required; include `initialize.authMethods`.
- commands_update: send `available_commands_update` with a sample list.

Emitted Content (per ACP)
- agent_message_chunk, user_message_chunk, agent_thought_chunk (Markdown/text and images)
- plan (replace‚Äëon‚Äëupdate semantics)
- tool_call (with kind/status/title/content/locations/rawInput)
- tool_call_update (status changes + content/location updates)
- request_permission (options: allow_once/always, reject_once/always)
- available_commands_update (for slash UX)

Controls
- Speed: `--speed=slomo|normal|fast|max` or numeric multiplier.
- Pause/step: simulator responds to SIGUSR1 or stdin keycodes to pause/resume/step.
- Jitter: `--jitter-ms` adds random delay noise around scripted timings for realism.
- Seed: `--seed` to reproduce interleavings and generated content.

Integration
- Add a RAT flag `--agent-cmd <path>` (or config override) to spawn a custom agent; use it to launch the simulator. If not present, add as a small CLI addition in a follow‚Äëup.
- Default simulator command: `cargo run -q --example sim_agent -- --scenario happy_path_edit --speed fast`.

Testing
- Use `insta` snapshots of TUI frames for each scenario (freeze speed, seed=0, deterministic timestamps). Validate: plan rendering, tool card lifecycle, diff view, permission modal flows, stop reasons, command palette list.
- Add property tests for diff view invariants (e.g., toggling hunks never loses lines; accept/reject selection state independent of scroll).
- Mutation tests: parsing and state reducers for session updates.

Minimal Implementation Sketch (sim_agent.rs)
- implement Agent::initialize returning protocol v1 + promptCapabilities { embeddedContext: true, image: true }.
- Agent::new_session: incrementing session ids.
- Agent::prompt: spawn a task that emits the chosen scenario‚Äôs scripted notifications to `session_notification()`, then return `stop_reason` at the end (unless cancelled).
- Agent::cancel: set cancelled flag; scenario runner drains pending updates then sets final stop reason.
- ToolCallContent::diff: construct from small fixture strings embedded in the example.

Verification
- Manually: run RAT against the simulator to perform human UI testing; adjust speed and step to inspect states.
- Automated: scenario smoke tests that run RAT headless and snapshot text frames.

Next
- Add `examples/sim_agent.rs` and wire a `--agent-cmd` override in RAT.
- Land one scenario (happy_path_edit) with plan/tool/diff/permission; then iterate others.
